DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP UUT5/UUT5a/BRAM_addr0 input pin UUT5/UUT5a/BRAM_addr0/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#2 Warning
