Single Joystick Controller
------------------------
Created for the PmodJSTK2


Digilent


No Support Material Needed!


NOTES:

  1. Screws holes are intended to be threaded in when screwing on a screw
  2. The snap-on feature is strong enough to hold the case together, but screws are an option if wanted.
  3. A custom light pipe can be made with a hot glue gun if you choose not to purchase a lightpipe.


3D Printing Recommendations:

  1. Print all parts individually.
  2. Print at a low layer height, example 0.1mm
