2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2a/FSM_sequential_FSM_State_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2a/FSM_sequential_FSM_State_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2a/FSM_sequential_FSM_State_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2a/PixelSel_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2a/Red_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2a/ball_inX_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2a/ball_inY_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin UUT2/UUT2b/ROM_Red_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock UUT0/ClockGen_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin UUT0/ClockGen_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_100MHz_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): UUT0/clk_100MHz, UUT2/clk_100MHz, clk_100MHz_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>
